            <h4>The Beginning of a Fresh Baked Blog</h4>

            <p>
              Dreams. We all have them. My mom would always tell me we would run
              a bakery together. I thought she was a little nut-so at the time.
              I was little. I wanted to be a doctor, lawyer, singer - anything,
              but a baker. Funny how things change. College. Somewhere while
              studying to become an actuary (a numbers scientist) I felt a
              gravitational pull toward the kitchen. Was it my memories of
              baking with my mom? Was it my dad's entrepreneurial mindset
              rubbing off on me? I don't know, but it didn't take long for me to
              accept that calling and change my major to Business Management.
              Why not culinary arts? My mom would always tell me that culinary
              school is a waste I can learn from watching, trying, and trying
              and trying again. "The little engine that could. I think I can. I
              think I can. I think I can." She would say while flipping the
              donuts or folding the kouchen. So I began my journey. Bluebird
              Cakery. I got my internship. I helped this startup company get off
              the ground and grew so much in this company I don't have enough
              good words to say about my mentor Kelsy Wilison. At Bluebird I
              learned how to effectively run a business and decorate a cake. My
              internship evolved to a job where I got to become the Store
              Manager!! NO WAY! Dreams do come true! Right? Well almost. My
              heart. My calling. It is not in Faribault, MN. It is in my roots
              where my calling was sparked. The kitchen I grew up in. The area I
              grew up in. That calling got stronger after I had a kid. I left my
              DREAM JOB and moved my little family to where my heart yearned.
              Fulda, MN. I grew up 4 miles west of Heron Lake, MN. Not far from
              Fulda. My husband grew up outside of Fulda. Most of my family has
              moved far away or joined God. My husband’s family is still pretty
              centrally located around Fulda. My heart is close enough to the
              farm I grew up on to be satisfied. My kids are growing up knowing
              their cousins. I can run a bakery anywhere right? RIGHT! Bake M.D.
              No, I am not a doctor. M is for MaDonna. My mom, she would plan
              out baking days then wake up at 2 a.m. and start. Isn’t no way
              anyone in their right mind will get up at 2 a.m. to bake for fun?
              Except my mom. So I would not join her until 8 am like a normal
              person. Oh, but by 8 a.m. my mom is finishing the last donuts and
              has the whole day done. "It's okay we can run to the store and
              make more." My favorite part? Handing the goodies out to
              neighbors, friends, relatives, complete strangers and seeing the
              joy sparked by our simple gesture. D is for David. My dad, he
              would see value in everything. He would turn nothing into
              something. He is my constant inspiration to create and work hard.
              This company is the beginning of my dreams. This page. This is
              where I will share my dreams with you. I will use the blog to
              share my experiences as I try and try and try new recipes again. I
              will also use this site to share my products, my decorating
              classes, my heart. Enjoy.

            <h4>Starting Every Cake with a Solid Recipe</h4>

            <p>
              This week I was asked to make a teacher appreciation cake for the
              teachers that helped develop me. Teachers you really do touch our
              lives forever. I always LOVED school. I still remember story time
              in second grade with Mrs. Aiden. When it was my turn to pick the
              bonus spelling word in 1st grade with Mrs. Millbrath - she thought
              I would pick a hard word like elephant, I choose "it" because my
              dad would always make a joke about hard words to spell and ask me
              to spell "it."😂 My love of math was sparked in Mr. Zellar's
              class. Mrs. Renzikoski would do so much to make spanish fun
              including serving up spanish food🥰🥰. I'll never forget making a
              haunted house in Mr. Graef's class and Ms. Guenther always had
              good book lists. My thank you to teachers list doesn't end there.
              I could never list all the moments all the teachers. You would ve
              reading forever! Instead enjoy this cake.

            <h4>Piping Chocolate Cake, Surrounded by Love</h4>

            <p>
              There is just something so satisfying about chocolate drippage.
              The way it looks so smooth The way it shines when the light hits.
              The way it spreads across the top When it hits the edge and just
              every so slowly spills until it comes to that unpredictable stop
              halfway down the cake. I could keep explaining or you can just
              watch the satisfaction right here.

            <h4>Lets Talk About Ermine Frosting</h4>

            <p>
              Lets talk about Ermine frosting. This cake was a bit of a
              challenge for me. "I want a fresh summer cake. With whipped
              frosting" Okay well my favorite stabilized whip product is hard to
              get small scale. And heavy whip stabilized has a 24 hour "life." I
              asked a LOT of bakers and a lot of them suggested adding pudding
              to the heavy whip. 🤢 Then one person suggested Ermine. I have
              never heard of it. Looked it up and it reminded me of a recipe my
              mom has flagged as "Very good" but THERE'S FLOUR IN IT! That fact
              alone kept me away from it. I am SO GLAD I tried this recipe. It
              is SO LIGHT AND FLUFFY! not quite whipped cream but the texture is
              like marshmellows and the flavor is simple like my white cake.
              Anyways here is what I learned. 👉Roux - Flour and milk simmerred
              to a thick paste 👉Creating a roux takes patience and the thicker
              the better. 👉Stick your roux in the fridge or make it the night
              before if leaving at room temp to cool. 👉A whisk makes a fluffier
              frosting than a paddle attachment. 👉The world of frosting is vast
              and wide. Next I'm trying Russian Buttercream. Any other
              requests?😍 Feeling proud in Fulda, Minnesota.
